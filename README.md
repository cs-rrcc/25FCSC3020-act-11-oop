# Overview

The goal of this activity is to practice some of the most fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

# Instructions 

You are given two source files: 

* [src/models.py](src/models.py) contains the model classes
* [src/main.py](src/main.py) is a script that demonstrates how to use the model classes

## Singleton Design Pattern

Apply the Singleton Design Pattern to the Rectangle class so that only a single instance of the object is ever created. 

## The Rectangle Class 

Complete the TO-DOs in main to demonstrate how to use the Rectangle class. 

## The Vehicle Class

Complete the TO-DOs in main to demonstrate how to use the Vehicle class and its specialized subclasses.

## The Iterator

Complete the TO-DO in main to demonstrate an iteration process using the MyNumbers class. 

## The BSTNode Class

Complete the TO-DOs in main to demonstrate how to use the BSTNode class.

Next, complete the TO-DO in models to implement an iterator for the BSTNode class. 

## The Generator

Complete the TO-DO in models to implement a generator for the BSTNode class. Demonstrate how the generator can be used to iterate over the BSTNode objects in a list.
